### Game Overview

CryptoDraw is an innovative blockchain-based lottery system that combines the transparency and security of blockchain technology with the excitement of traditional lottery games. At its core, CryptoDraw utilizes Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to ensure that every draw is conducted with absolute fairness and randomness. This integration guarantees that all participants have an equal chance of winning, with no possibility of tampering or manipulation.

Participants engage in the game by purchasing tickets using native ERC20 tokens. These tokens serve as the currency within the CryptoDraw ecosystem, facilitating all transactions. To buy a ticket, players select a set of numbers and make a payment in native tokens equivalent to the ticket price, which is determined based on the USD value converted to the native token. Upon successful payment, a unique NFT is minted for each ticket, recording the chosen numbers and confirming the player's entry into the draw.

The draw itself is managed automatically through Chainlink Keepers, which ensure that draws occur at regular intervals, such as every four days. Winning numbers are generated through Chainlink VRF, providing a verifiable and transparent method of determining the outcomes. This random number generation process is crucial for maintaining the integrity and fairness of the game.

After the draw, the winning numbers are announced, and players can check their tickets to see if their numbers match the winning combination. If a player’s numbers align with the winning numbers, they can claim their prize directly through the CryptoDraw platform. The prize money is distributed from the prize pool, which accumulates from ticket sales. A significant portion of the prize pool is allocated to player winnings, while a percentage is set aside for agent commissions. Agents, who facilitate ticket sales, receive commissions based on their performance, ensuring their engagement and motivation.

CryptoDraw’s design ensures a high level of security and transparency. The use of blockchain technology for ticket issuance and prize distribution minimizes risks and provides a clear, immutable record of all transactions. Players and agents can track their activities and earnings, fostering trust in the system. By integrating advanced technologies and adhering to rigorous security standards, CryptoDraw offers a modern and exciting lottery experience that aligns with the principles of fairness and transparency.
